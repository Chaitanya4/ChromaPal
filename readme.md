# ChromaPal

Colors add uniqueness and beauty to everything that we see in our lives. Color blindness (colour vision deficiency, or CVD) affects approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women in the world. People with color blindness face difficulties in seeing some colors while surfing through the websites - they don't get to see the content which are displayed in the colors which they can not see clearly.

ChromaPal is a Chrome browser extension which optimizes any web page according to the type of color blindness faced by the user. ChromaPal provides better accessibility to people with color blindness by changing the color scheme of the website to a color comfortable according to the type of color blindness faced by the users.

All the content including images, texts, buttons and backgrounds are automatically changed into the color scheme which is comfortable for the user using this chrome extension.
